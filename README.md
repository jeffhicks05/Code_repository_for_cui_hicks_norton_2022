This repository contains code for Cui, Hicks, Norton 2022: How Well-Targeted are Payroll Tax Cuts as a Response to COVID-19? Evidence from China; International Tax and Public Finance

The data is proprietary tax returns and financial statements for one province in China, and so is not publicly-available.

All replication code is included. master_covid_draft2022.do is the main do-file which calls all subsequent code files.

All output files loaded in the .tex document are also included, so readers can follow filenames to the code.

Code was written jointly by Max Norton and Jeff Hicks. All questions should be forwarded to all three authors: jeffrey.hicks@utoronto.ca; max.norton@ubc.ca; cui@allard.ubc.ca .
